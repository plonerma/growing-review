  abstract = {In recent years, deep learning has been connected with optimal control as a way to define a notion of a continuous underlying learning problem. In this view, neural networks can be interpreted as a discretization of a parametric Ordinary Differential Equation which, in the limit, defines a continuous-depth neural network. The learning task then consists in finding the best ODE parameters for the problem under consideration, and their number increases with the accuracy of the time discretization. Although important steps have been taken to realize the advantages of such continuous formulations, most current learning techniques fix a discretization (i.e. the number of layers is fixed). In this work, we propose an iterative adaptive algorithm where we progressively refine the time discretization (i.e. we increase the number of layers). Provided that certain tolerances are met across the iterations, we prove that the strategy converges to the underlying continuous problem. One salient advantage of such a shallow-to-deep approach is that it helps to benefit in practice from the higher approximation properties of deep networks by mitigating over-parametrization issues. The performance of the approach is illustrated in several numerical examples.},

  abstract = {Techniques for automatically designing deep neural network architectures such as reinforcement learning based approaches have recently shown promising results. However, their success is based on vast computational resources (e.g. hundreds of GPUs), making them difficult to be widely used. A noticeable limitation is that they still design and train each network from scratch during the exploration of the architecture space, which is highly inefficient. In this paper, we propose a new framework toward efficient architecture search by exploring the architecture space based on the current network and reusing its weights. We employ a reinforcement learning agent as the meta-controller, whose action is to grow the network depth or layer width with function-preserving transformations. As such, the previously validated networks can be reused for further exploration, thus saves a large amount of computational cost. We apply our method to explore the architecture space of the plain convolutional neural networks (no skip-connections, branching etc.) on image benchmark datasets (CIFAR-10, SVHN) with restricted computational resources (5 GPUs). Our method can design highly competitive networks that outperform existing networks using the same design scheme. On CIFAR-10, our model without skip-connections achieves 4.23\textbackslash\% test error rate, exceeding a vast majority of modern architectures and approaching DenseNet. Furthermore, by applying our method to explore the DenseNet architecture space, we are able to achieve more accurate networks with fewer parameters.},

The flatness of the surface of the loss function in a neighborhood of such minima is often linked with better generalization performances. In this paper, we present a new model of growing neural network in which we incrementally add neurons throughout the learning phase. We study the characteristics of the minima found by such a network compared to those obtained with standard feedforward neural networks. The results of this analysis show that a neural network grown with our procedure converges towards a flatter minimum than a standard neural network with the same number of parameters learned from scratch. Furthermore, our results confirm the link between flatter minima and better generalization performances as the grown models tend to outperform the standard ones. We validate this approach both with small neural networks and with large deep learning models that are state-of-the-art in Natural Language Processing tasks.},

This network transformation allows reusing previously trained networks and existing successful architectures that improves sample efficiency. We aim to address the limitation of current network transformation operations that can only perform layer-level architecture modifications, such as adding (pruning) filters or inserting (removing) a layer, which fails to change the topology of connection paths. Our proposed path-level transformation operations enable the meta-controller to modify the path topology of the given network while keeping the merits of reusing weights, and thus allow efficiently designing effective structures with complex path topologies like Inception models. We further propose a bidirectional tree-structured reinforcement learning meta-controller to explore a simple yet highly expressive tree-structured architecture space that can be viewed as a generalization of multi-branch architectures. We experimented on the image classification datasets with limited computational resources (about 200 GPU-hours), where we observed improved parameter efficiency and better test results (97.70\% test accuracy on CIFAR-10 with 14.3M parameters and 74.6\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet in the mobile setting), demonstrating the effectiveness and transferability of our designed architectures.},

The main purpose is to accelerate the training of a significantly larger neural net. During real-world workflows, one often trains very many different neural networks during the experimentation and design process. This is a wasteful process in which each new model is trained from scratch. Our Net2Net technique accelerates the experimentation process by instantaneously transferring the knowledge from a previous network to each new deeper or wider network. Our techniques are based on the concept of function-preserving transformations between neural network specifications. This differs from previous approaches to pre-training that altered the function represented by a neural net when adding layers to it. Using our knowledge transfer mechanism to add depth to Inception modules, we demonstrate a new state of the art accuracy rating on the ImageNet dataset.},

To address this issue, we propose the Reinforced Evolutionary Neural Architecture Search (RENAS), which is an evolutionary method with reinforced mutation for NAS. Our method integrates reinforced mutation into an evolution algorithm for neural architecture exploration, in which a mutation controller is introduced to learn the effects of slight modifications and make mutation actions. The reinforced mutation controller guides the model population to evolve efficiently. Furthermore, as child models can inherit parameters from their parents during evolution, our method requires very limited computational resources. In experiments, we conduct the proposed search method on CIFAR-10 and obtain a powerful network architecture, RENASNet. This architecture achieves a competitive result on CIFAR-10. The explored network architecture is transferable to ImageNet and achieves a new state-of-the-art accuracy, i.e., 75.7\% top-1 accuracy with 5.36M parameters on mobile ImageNet. We further test its performance on semantic segmentation with DeepLabv3 on the PASCAL VOC. RENASNet outperforms MobileNetv1, MobileNet-v2 and NASNet. It achieves 75.83\% mIOU without being pretrained on COCO. The code for training and evaluating ImageNet models is available at https: //github.com/yukang2017/RENAS.},

  abstract = {The general success criterion for an artificial intelligence system is its ability to mimic human brain learning. Throughout a lifetime, the human brain is capable of continual learning. The acquired information is kept, augmented, finetuned, and utilized to complete new tasks in the future. At the moment, machine learning models perform well when given precisely structured, balanced, and homogenized data. However, when several jobs with incremental data are provided, the performance of the majority of these models suffers. Inspired by the Complementary Learning Systems (CLS) theory in neuroscience, episodic-semantic memory-based frameworks have received much attention and research. On the other hand, conventional methods are needed to perform data batch normalization and are sensitive to vigilance hyperparameters across different datasets. This paper proposes a Robust Growing Memory Network (RGMN) that continuously learns incoming data without normalization and is unlikely to be affected by the vigilance hyperparameter. The RGMN is a self-organizing topological network that models human episodic memory, and its network size can grow and shrink in response to data. The long-term memory buffer retains the largest and smallest data values that will use for learning. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we conducted comparative experiments on real-world datasets, and results showed that the proposed method outperforms existing memory-based baseline frameworks in terms of accuracy.},

For example, a smaller sub-network produces smooth and lowfrequency signals, while a larger sub-network can represent fine details.

It seems handy to include an additional skip connection in the search space to make depths variable. However, it creates a large range of perturbation during super-net training and it has difficulty giving a confident ranking for subnetworks. In this paper, we discover that skip connections bring about significant feature inconsistency compared with other operations, which potentially degrades the supernet performance. Based on this observation, we tackle the problem by imposing an equivariant learnable stabilizer to homogenize such disparities (see Fig. 1). Experiments show that our proposed stabilizer helps to improve the supernet's convergence as well as ranking performance. With an evolutionary search backend that incorporates the stabilized supernet as an evaluator, we derive a family of state-of-the-art architectures, the SCARLET1 series of several depths, especially SCARLET-A obtains 76.9\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet.},

Instead of developing new building blocks or using computationally-intensive reinforcement learning algorithms, our approach leverages existing efficient network building blocks and focuses on exploiting hardware traits and adapting computation resources to fit target latency and/or energy constraints. We formulate platform-aware NN architecture search in an optimization framework and propose a novel algorithm to search for optimal architectures aided by efficient accuracy and resource (latency and/or energy) predictors. At the core of our algorithm lies an accuracy predictor built atop Gaussian Process with Bayesian optimization for iterative sampling. With a one-time building cost for the predictors, our algorithm produces state-of-the-art model architectures on different platforms under given constraints in just minutes. Our results show that adapting computation resources to building blocks is critical to model performance.

This incurs model redundancy, increases run-time delay, and makes the LSTMs more prone to overfitting. To address these problems, we propose a hidden-layer LSTM (H-LSTM) that adds hidden layers to LSTM's original one level non-linear control gates. H-LSTM increases accuracy while employing fewer external stacked layers, thus reducing the number of parameters and run-time latency significantly. We employ grow-and-prune (GP) training to iteratively adjust the hidden layers through gradient-based growth and magnitude-based pruning of connections. This learns both the weights and the compact architecture of H-LSTM control gates. We have GP-trained H-LSTMs for image captioning and speech recognition applications. For the NeuralTalk architecture on the MSCOCO dataset, our three models reduce the number of parameters by 38.7x [floating-point operations (FLOPs) by 45.5x], run-time latency by 4.5x, and improve the CIDEr score by 2.6. For the DeepSpeech2 architecture on the AN4 dataset, our two models reduce the number of parameters by 19.4x (FLOPs by 23.5x), run-time latency by 15.7\%, and the word error rate from 12.9\% to 8.7\%.

  abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) have begun to have a pervasive impact on various applications of machine learning. However, the problem of finding an optimal DNN architecture for large applications is challenging. Common approaches go for deeper and larger DNN architectures but may incur substantial redundancy. To address these problems, we introduce a network growth algorithm that complements network pruning to learn both weights and compact DNN architectures during training. We propose a DNN synthesis tool (NeST) that combines both methods to automate the generation of compact and accurate DNNs. NeST starts with a randomly initialized sparse network called the seed architecture. It iteratively tunes the architecture with gradient-based growth and magnitude-based pruning of neurons and connections. Our experimental results show that NeST yields accurate, yet very compact DNNs, with a wide range of seed architecture selection. For the LeNet-300-100 (LeNet-5) architecture, we reduce network parameters by 70.2x (74.3x) and floating-point operations (FLOPs) by 79.4x (43.7x). For the AlexNet and VGG-16 architectures, we reduce network parameters (FLOPs) by 15.7x (4.6x) and 30.2x (8.6x), respectively. NeST's grow-and-prune paradigm delivers significant additional parameter and FLOPs reduction relative to pruning-only methods.},

  abstract = {Neural architecture search (NAS) has achieved breakthrough success in a great number of applications in the past few years. It could be time to take a step back and analyze the good and bad aspects in the field of NAS. A variety of algorithms search architectures under different search space. These searched architectures are trained using different setups, e.g., hyper-parameters, data augmentation, regularization. This raises a comparability problem when comparing the performance of various NAS algorithms. NAS-Bench-101 has shown success to alleviate this problem. In this work, we propose an extension to NAS-Bench-101: NAS-Bench201 with a different search space, results on multiple datasets, and more diagnostic information. NAS-Bench-201 has a fixed search space and provides a unified benchmark for almost any up-to-date NAS algorithms. The design of our search space is inspired from the one used in the most popular cell-based searching algorithms, where a cell is represented as a directed acyclic graph. Each edge here is associated with an operation selected from a predefined operation set. For it to be applicable for all NAS algorithms, the search space defined in NAS-Bench-201 includes all possible architectures generated by 4 nodes and 5 associated operation options, which results in 15,625 neural cell candidates in total. The training log using the same setup and the performance for each architecture candidate are provided for three datasets. This allows researchers to avoid unnecessary repetitive training for selected architecture and focus solely on the search algorithm itself. The training time saved for every architecture also largely improves the efficiency of most NAS algorithms and brings a more computational cost friendly NAS community for a broader range of researchers. We provide additional diagnostic information such as fine-grained loss and accuracy, which can give inspirations to new designs of NAS algorithms. In further support of the proposed NAS-Bench201, we have analyzed it from many aspects and benchmarked 10 recent NAS algorithms, which verify its applicability.},

  abstract = {Network pruning reduces the computation costs of an over-parameterized network without performance damage. Prevailing pruning algorithms pre-define the width and depth of the pruned networks, and then transfer parameters from the unpruned network to pruned networks. To break the structure limitation of the pruned networks, we propose to apply neural architecture search to search directly for a network with flexible channel and layer sizes. The number of the channels/layers is learned by minimizing the loss of the pruned networks. The feature map of the pruned network is an aggregation of K feature map fragments (generated by K networks of different sizes), which are sampled based on the probability distribution. The loss can be back-propagated not only to the network weights, but also to the parameterized distribution to explicitly tune the size of the channels/layers. Specifically, we apply channel-wise interpolation to keep the feature map with different channel sizes aligned in the aggregation procedure. The maximum probability for the size in each distribution serves as the width and depth of the pruned network, whose parameters are learned by knowledge transfer, e.g., knowledge distillation, from the original networks. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet demonstrate the effectiveness of our new perspective of network pruning compared to traditional network pruning algorithms. Various searching and knowledge transfer approaches are conducted to show the effectiveness of the two components. Code is at: https://github.com/D-X-Y/NAS-Projects.},

  abstract = {Deep neural networks achieve remarkable performance in many computer vision tasks. Most state-of-the-art (SOTA) semantic segmentation and object detection approaches reuse neural network architectures designed for image classification as the backbone, commonly pre-trained on ImageNet. However, performance gains can be achieved by designing network architectures specifically for detection and segmentation, as shown by recent neural architecture search (NAS) research for detection and segmentation. One major challenge though, is that ImageNet pre-training of the search space representation (a.k.a. super network) or the searched networks incurs huge computational cost. In this paper, we propose a Fast Neural Network Adaptation (FNA) method, which can adapt both the architecture and parameters of a seed network (e.g. a high performing manually designed backbone) to become a network with different depth, width, or kernels via a Parameter Remapping technique, making it possible to utilize NAS for detection/segmentation tasks a lot more efficiently. In our experiments, we conduct FNA on MobileNetV2 to obtain new networks for both segmentation and detection that clearly out-perform existing networks designed both manually and by NAS. The total computation cost of FNA is significantly less than SOTA segmentation/detection NAS approaches: 1737\texttimes{} less than DPC, 6.8\texttimes{} less than Auto-DeepLab and 7.4\texttimes{} less than DetNAS.

  abstract = {Deep learning has achieved state-of-the-art accuracies on several computer vision tasks. However, the computational and energy requirements associated with training such deep neural networks can be quite high. In this paper, we propose a cumulative training strategy with Net2Net transformation that achieves training computational efficiency without incurring large accuracy loss, in comparison to a model trained from scratch. We achieve this by first training a small network (with lesser parameters) on a small subset of the original dataset, and then gradually expanding the network using Net2Net transformation to train incrementally on larger subsets of the dataset. This incremental training strategy with Net2Net utilizes function-preserving transformations that transfers knowledge from each previous small network to the next larger network, thereby, reducing the overall training complexity. Our experiments demonstrate that compared with training from scratch, cumulative training yields 2x reduction in computational complexity for training TinyImageNet using VGG19 at iso-accuracy. Besides training efficiency, a key advantage of our cumulative training strategy is that we can perform pruning during Net2Net expansion to obtain a final network with optimal configuration ( 0.4x lower inference compute complexity) compared to conventional training from scratch. We also demonstrate that the final network obtained from cumulative training yields better generalization performance and noise robustness. Further, we show that mutual inference from all the networks created with cumulative Net2Net expansion enables improved adversarial input detection.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we focus on online representation learning in non-stationary environments which may require continuous adaptation of model's architecture. We propose a novel online dictionary-learning (sparse-coding) framework which incorporates the addition and deletion of hidden units (dictionary elements), and is inspired by the adult neurogenesis phenomenon in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, known to be associated with improved cognitive function and adaptation to new environments. In the online learning setting, where new input instances arrive sequentially in batches, the ``neuronal birth'' is implemented by adding new units with random initial weights (random dictionary elements); the number of new units is determined by the current performance (representation error) of the dictionary, higher error causing an increase in the birth rate. ``Neuronal death'' is implemented by imposing l1/l2-regularization (group sparsity) on the dictionary within the block-coordinate descent optimization at each iteration of our online alternating minimization scheme, which iterates between the code and dictionary updates. Finally, hidden unit connectivity adaptation is facilitated by introducing sparsity in dictionary elements. Our empirical evaluation on several real-life datasets (images and language) as well as on synthetic data demonstrates that the proposed approach can considerably outperform the state-of-art fixed-size (nonadaptive) online sparse coding of Mairal et al. (2009) in the presence of nonstationary data. Moreover, we identify certain properties of the data (e.g., sparse inputs with nearly non-overlapping supports) and of the model (e.g., dictionary sparsity) associated with such improvements.},

  abstract = {Unsupervised pre-training is popularly used in natural language processing. By designing proper unsupervised prediction tasks, a deep neural network can be trained and shown to be effective in many downstream tasks. As the data is usually adequate, the model for pre-training is generally huge and contains millions of parameters. Therefore, the training efficiency becomes a critical issue even when using high-performance hardware. In this paper, we explore an efficient training method for the state-of-the-art bidirectional Transformer (BERT) model. By visualizing the self-attention distribution of different layers at different positions in a well-trained BERT model, we find that in most layers, the self-attention distribution will concentrate locally around its position and the start-of-sentence token. Motivating from this, we propose the stacking algorithm to transfer knowledge from a shallow model to a deep model; then we apply stacking progressively to accelerate BERT training. The experimental results showed that the models trained by our training strategy achieve similar performance to models trained from scratch, but our algorithm is much faster.},

Moreover, we propose a new elastic search space that can flexibly condense or expand during the optimization process, allowing the network optimization of width and depth in a bi-direction manner. By DNA, we successfully achieve network architecture optimization by condensing and expanding in both width and depth dimensions. Extensive experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that DNA can adapt the existing network to meet different targeted computation requirements with better performance than previous methods. What's more, DNA can further improve the performance of high-accuracy networks obtained by state-of-the-art neural architecture search methods such as EfficientNet and MobileNet-v3.},

First, we find that similar to network architecture search, Transformer growth also favors compound scaling. Specifically, while existing methods only conduct network growth in a single dimension, we observe that it is beneficial to use compound growth operators and balance multiple dimensions (e.g., depth, width, and input length of the model). Moreover, we explore alternative growth operators in each dimension via controlled comparison to give operator selection practical guidance. In light of our analyses, the proposed method speeds up BERT pre-training by 73.6\% and 82.2\% for the base and large models respectively, while achieving comparable performances},

On the ImageNet dataset, for the VGG-16 and MobileNetV2 architectures, we reduce network parameters by \$8.0\textbackslash times \$ and \$1.3\textbackslash times \$ , respectively, with a similar or improved performance over their respective baselines. We also evaluate the efficacy of using dimensionality reduction alongside SCANN (DR+SCANN) on nine small-to-medium-size datasets. Using this methodology enables us to reduce the number of connections in the network by up to \$5078.7\textbackslash times \$ (geometric mean: \$82.1\textbackslash times \$ ), with little to no drop in accuracy. On seven out of nine datasets, we show 0.41\%\textendash 10.09\% accuracy improvements over the FC baseline models. We also show that our synthesis methodology yields neural networks that are much better at navigating the accuracy versus energy efficiency space. This can enable neural network-based inference even on Internet-of-Things sensors.},

  abstract = {Neural networks (NNs) have been successfully deployed in various applications of Artificial Intelligence. However, architectural design of these models is still a challenging problem. This is due to the need to navigate a large number of hyperparameters that forces the search space of possible architectures to grow exponentially. Furthermore, using a trial-and-error design approach is very time-consuming and leads to suboptimal architectures. In addition, neural networks are known to have a lot of redundancy. This increases the computational cost of inference and poses a severe obstacle to deployment on Internet-of-Thing (IoT) sensors and edge devices. To address these challenges, we propose the STEERAGE synthesis methodology. It consists of two complementary approaches: intelligent and efficient architecture search, and grow-and-prune NN synthesis. The first step, incorporated in a global search module, uses an accuracy predictor to efficiently navigate the architectural search space. This predictor is built using boosted decision tree regression, iterative sampling, and efficient evolutionary search. This step starts from a base architecture and explores the architecture search space to obtain a variant of the base architecture with the highest performance. The second step involves local search. By taking advantage of various grow-and-prune methodologies for synthesizing convolutional and feed-forward NNs, it not only reduces network redundancy and computational cost, but also boosts model performance. We have evaluated STEERAGE performance on various datasets, including MNIST and CIFAR-10. We demonstrate significant accuracy improvements over the baseline architectures. For the MNIST dataset, our CNN architecture achieves an error rate of 0.66\%, with 8.6\texttimes{} fewer parameters compared to the LeNet-5 baseline. For the CIFAR-10 dataset, we used the ResNet architectures as the baseline. Our STEERAGE-synthesized ResNet-18 has a 2.52\% accuracy improvement over the original ResNet-18, 1.74\% over ResNet-101, and 0.16\% over ResNet-1001, while requiring the number of parameters and floating-point operations comparable to the original ResNet-18. This demonstrates that instead of just increasing the number of layers to increase accuracy, an alternative is to use a better NN architecture with a small number of layers. In addition, STEERAGE achieves an error rate of just 3.86\% with a variant of ResNet architecture with 40 layers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest accuracy obtained by ResNet-based architectures on the CIFAR-10 dataset. STEERAGE also obtains the highest accuracy for various other feedforward NNs geared towards edge devices and IoT sensors.},

First, we propose a Parametric Rectified Linear Unit (PReLU) that generalizes the traditional rectified unit. PReLU improves model fitting with nearly zero extra computational cost and little overfitting risk. Second, we derive a robust initialization method that particularly considers the rectifier nonlinearities. This method enables us to train extremely deep rectified models directly from scratch and to investigate deeper or wider network architectures. Based on the learnable activation and advanced initialization, we achieve 4.94\% top-5 test error on the ImageNet 2012 classification dataset. This is a 26\% relative improvement over the ILSVRC 2014 winner (GoogLeNet, 6.66\% [33]).

Existing methods often rely on static architectures that are manually crafted. These methods can be prone to capacity saturation because a neural network's ability to generalize to new concepts is limited by its fixed capacity. To understand how to expand a continual learner, we focus on the neural architecture design problem in the context of class-incremental learning: at each time step, the learner must optimize its performance on all classes observed so far by selecting the most competitive neural architecture. To tackle this problem, we propose Continual Neural Architecture Search (CNAS): an autoML approach that takes advantage of the sequential nature of class-incremental learning to efficiently and adaptively identify strong architectures in a continual learning setting. We employ a task network to perform the classification task and a reinforcement learning agent as the meta-controller for architecture search. In addition, we apply network transformations to transfer weights from previous learning step and to reduce the size of the architecture search space, thus saving a large amount of computational resources. We evaluate CNAS on the CIFAR-100 dataset under varied incremental learning scenarios with limited computational power (1 GPU). Experimental results demonstrate that CNAS outperforms architectures that are optimized for the entire dataset. In addition, CNAS is at least an order of magnitude more efficient than naively using existing autoML methods.},

There are two main challenges in classincremental learning: catastrophic forgetting and capacity saturation. In this work, we focus on capacity saturation where a learner is unable to achieve good generalization due to its limited capacity. To understand how to increase model capacity, we present the continual architecture design problem where at any given step, a continual learner needs to adapt its architecture to achieve a good balance between performance, computational cost and memory limitations. To address this problem, we propose Continual Neural Architecture Search (CNAS) which takes advantage of the sequential nature of classincremental learning to efficiently identify strong architectures.

Our approach leverages the principles of deep model compression, critical weights selection, and progressive networks expansion. By enforcing their integration in an iterative manner, we introduce an incremental learning method that is scalable to the number of sequential tasks in a continual learning process. Our approach is easy to implement and owns several favorable characteristics. First, it can avoid forgetting (i.e., learn new tasks while remembering all previous tasks). Second, it allows model expansion but can maintain the model compactness when handling sequential tasks. Besides, through our compaction and selection/expansion mechanism, we show that the knowledge accumulated through learning previous tasks is helpful to build a better model for the new tasks compared to training the models independently with tasks. Experimental results show that our approach can incrementally learn a deep model tackling multiple tasks without forgetting, while the model compactness is maintained with the performance more satisfiable than individual task training.},

  abstract = {This study focuses on the highest-level adaption for deep neural networks, which is at structure or architecture level. To determine the optimal neural network structures, usually we need to search for the architectures with methods like random search, evolutionary algorithm and gradient based methods. However, the existing studies mainly apply pre-defined backbones with fixed sizes, which requires certain level of manual selection and in lack of flexibility in handling incremental datasets or online data streams. This study aims at making the architecture search process more adaptive for one-shot or online training. It is extended from the existing study on differentiable neural architecture search, and we made the backbone architecture transformable rather than fixed during the training process. As is known, differentiable neural architecture search (DARTS) requires a pre-defined over-parameterized backbone architecture, while its size is to be determined manually. Also, in DARTS backbone, Hadamard product of two elements is not introduced, which exists in both LSTM and GRU cells for recurrent nets. This study introduces a growing mechanism for differentiable neural architecture search based on network morphism. It enables growing of the cell structures from small size towards large size ones with one-shot training. Two modes can be applied in integrating the growing and original pruning process. We also implement a recently proposed two-input backbone architecture for recurrent neural networks. Initial experimental results indicate that our approach and the two-input backbone structure can be quite effective compared with other baseline architectures including LSTM, in a variety of learning tasks including multi-variate time series forecasting and language modeling. On the other hand, we find that dynamic network transformation is promising in improving the efficiency of differentiable architecture search.},

We take these results as a point of departure to devise a novel strategy for escaping from flat regions of the error surface and to address the slow-down of gradient-based methods experienced in plateaus of saddle points. The idea is to expand the dimensionality of a network in a way that guarantees the existence of new escape directions. We call this operation the opening of a tunnel. One may then continue with the larger network either temporarily, i.e.\textasciitilde closing the tunnel later, or permanently, i.e.\textasciitilde iteratively growing the network, whenever needed. We develop our method for fully-connected as well as convolutional layers.

In this paper, we propose a continual learning method that is able to learn additional tasks while retaining the performance of previously learned tasks by stacking parameters. Composed of two complementary components, the index module and the StackNet, our method estimates the index of the corresponding task for an input sample with the index module and utilizes a particular portion of StackNet with this index. The StackNet guarantees no degradation in the performance of the previously learned tasks and the index module shows high confidence in finding the origin of an input sample.

However, for many supervised models, the shift in a data distribution or the appearance of a new event can result in a severe decrease in model performance. Retraining a model from scratch with updated data can be resource intensive or impossible depending on the constraints placed on an organization or system. Continual learning methods attempt to adapt models to new classes instead of retraining. However, many of these methods do not have a detection method for new classes or make assumptions about the distribution of classes. In this paper, we develop an attention based Gaussian Mixture, called GMAT, that learns interpretable representations of data with or without labels. We incorporate this method with existing Neural Architecture Search techniques to develop an algorithm for detection new events for an optimal number of representations through an iterative process of training a growing. We show that our method is capable learning new representations of data without labels or assumptions about the distributions of labels. We additionally develop a method that allows our model to utilize labels to more accurately develop representations.

A recently released Graph HyperNetwork (GHN) trained this way on one million smaller ImageNet architectures is able to predict parameters for large unseen networks such as ResNet-50. While networks with predicted parameters lose performance on the source task, the predicted parameters have been found useful for fine-tuning on other tasks. We study if fine-tuning based on the same GHN is still useful on novel strong architectures that were published after the GHN had been trained. We found that for recent architectures such as ConvNeXt, GHN initialization becomes less useful than for ResNet-50. One potential reason is the increased distribution shift of novel architectures from those used to train the GHN. We also found that the predicted parameters lack the diversity necessary to successfully fine-tune parameters with gradient descent. We alleviate this limitation by applying simple post-processing techniques to predicted parameters before fine-tuning them on a target task and improve fine-tuning of ResNet-50 and ConvNeXt.},

  abstract = {Designing diverse neural architectures taking into account resource constraints or datasets is one of the main challenges in Neural Architecture Search (NAS). However, existing samplebased or one-shot NAS approaches require excessive time or computational cost to be used in multiple practical scenarios. Recently, to alleviate such issues, zero-shot NAS methods that are efficient proxies have been proposed, yet their performance is rather poor due to the strong assumption that they predict the final performance of a given architecture with random initialization. In this work, we propose a novel NAS based on block-wise parameter remapping (PR) and knowledge distillation (KD), which shows high predictive performance while being fast and lightweight enough to be used iteratively to support multiple real-world scenarios. PR significantly shortens training steps and accordingly we can reduce the required time/data for KD to work as an accurate proxy to just few batches, which is largely practical in real-world. In the experiments, we validate the proposed method for its accuracy estimation performance on CIFAR-10 from the MobileNetV3 search space. It outperforms all relevant baselines in terms of performance estimation with only 20 batches.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in vision Transformers (ViTs) have come with a voracious appetite for computing power, highlighting the urgent need to develop efficient training methods for ViTs. Progressive learning, a training scheme where the model capacity grows progressively during training, has started showing its ability in efficient training. In this paper, we take a practical step towards efficient training of ViTs by customizing and automating progressive learning. First, we develop a strong manual baseline for progressive learning of ViTs, by introducing momentum growth (MoGrow) to bridge the gap brought by model growth. Then, we propose automated progressive learning (AutoProg), an efficient training scheme that aims to achieve lossless acceleration by automatically increasing the training overload on-the-fly; this is achieved by adaptively deciding whether, where and how much should the model grow during progressive learning. Specifically, we first relax the optimization of the growth schedule to sub-network architecture optimization problem, then propose one-shot estimation of the sub-network performance via an elastic supernet. The searching overhead is reduced to minimal by recycling the parameters of the supernet. Extensive experiments of efficient training on ImageNet with two representative ViT models, DeiT and VOLO, demonstrate that AutoProg can accelerate ViTs training by up to 85.1\% with no performance drop.11Code:https://github.com/changlin31/AutoProg.},

  abstract = {Addressing catastrophic forgetting is one of the key challenges in continual learning where machine learning systems are trained with sequential or streaming tasks. Despite recent remarkable progress in state-of-the-art deep learning, deep neural networks (DNNs) are still plagued with the catastrophic forgetting problem. This paper presents a conceptually simple yet general and effective framework for handling catastrophic forgetting in continual learning with DNNs. The proposed method consists of two components: a neural structure optimization component and a parameter learning and/or fine-tuning component. By separating the explicit neural structure learning and the parameter estimation, not only is the proposed method capable of evolving neural structures in an intuitively meaningful way, but also shows strong capabilities of alleviating catastrophic forgetting in experiments. Furthermore, the proposed method outperforms all other baselines on the permuted MNIST dataset, the split CIFAR100 dataset and the Visual Domain Decathlon dataset in continual learning setting.},

  abstract = {Recent studies on deep convolutional neural networks present a simple paradigm of architecture design, i.e., models with more MACs typically achieve better accuracy, such as EfficientNet and RegNet. These works try to enlarge all the stages in the model with one unified rule by sampling and statistical methods. However, we observe that some network architectures have similar MACs and accuracies, but their allocations on computations for different stages are quite different. In this paper, we propose to enlarge the capacity of CNN models by improving their width, depth and resolution on stage level. Under the assumption that the top-performing smaller CNNs are a proper subcomponent of the top-performing larger CNNs, we propose an greedy network enlarging method based on the reallocation of computations. With step-by-step modifying the computations on different stages, the enlarged network will be equipped with optimal allocation and utilization of MACs. On EfficientNet, our method consistently outperforms the performance of the original scaling method. In particular, with application of our method on GhostNet, we achieve state-of-the-art 80.9\% and 84.3\% ImageNet top-1 accuracies under the setting of 600M and 4.4B MACs, respectively.},

Recent studies on automatic neural architecture search techniques have demonstrated significant performance, competitive to or even better than hand-crafted neural architectures. However, most of the existing search approaches tend to use residual structures and a concatenation connection between shallow and deep features. A resulted neural network model, therefore, is non-trivial for resource-constraint devices to execute since such a model requires large memory to store network parameters and intermediate feature maps along with excessive computing complexity. To address this challenge, we propose MemNAS, a novel growing and trimming based neural architecture search framework that optimizes not only performance but also memory requirement of an inference network. Specifically, in the search process, we consider running memory use, including network parameters and the essential intermediate feature maps memory requirement, as an optimization objective along with performance. Besides, to improve the accuracy of the search, we extract the correlation information among multiple candidate architectures to rank them and then choose the candidates with desired performance and memory efficiency. On the ImageNet classification task, our MemNAS achieves 75.4\% accuracy, 0.7\% higher than MobileNetV2 with 42.1\% less memory requirement. Additional experiments confirm that the proposed MemNAS can perform well across the different targets of the trade-off between accuracy and memory consumption.}

  abstract = {Catastrophic forgetting refers to the tendency that a neural network ``forgets'' the previous learned knowledge upon learning new tasks. Prior methods have been focused on overcoming this problem on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), where the input samples like images lie in a grid domain, but have largely overlooked graph neural networks (GNNs) that handle non-grid data. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme dedicated to overcoming catastrophic forgetting problem and hence strengthen continual learning in GNNs. At the heart of our approach is a generic module, termed as topology-aware weight preserving (TWP), applicable to arbitrary form of GNNs in a plug-and-play fashion. Unlike the main stream of CNN-based continual learning methods that rely on solely slowing down the updates of parameters important to the downstream task, TWP explicitly explores the local structures of the input graph, and attempts to stabilize the parameters playing pivotal roles in the topological aggregation. We evaluate TWP on different GNN backbones over several datasets, and demonstrate that it yields performances superior to the state of the art.

Theoretically, our splitting strategy is a second-order functional steepest descent for escaping saddle points in an {$\infty$}-Wasserstein metric space, on which the standard parametric gradient descent is a first-order steepest descent. Our method provides a new practical approach for optimizing neural network structures, especially for learning lightweight neural architectures in resource-constrained settings.},

  abstract = {Neural architecture search (NAS) has become increasingly popular in the deep learning community recently, mainly because it can provide an opportunity to allow interested users without rich expertise to benefit from the success of deep neural networks (DNNs). However, NAS is still laborious and time-consuming because a large number of performance estimations are required during the search process of NAS, and training DNNs is computationally intensive. To solve this major limitation of NAS, improving the computational efficiency is essential in the design of NAS. However, a systematic overview of computationally efficient NAS (CE-NAS) methods still lacks. To fill this gap, we provide a comprehensive survey of the stateof-the-art on CE-NAS by categorizing the existing work into proxy-based and surrogate-assisted NAS methods, together with a thorough discussion of their design principles and a quantitative comparison of their performances and computational complexities. The remaining challenges and open research questions are also discussed, and promising research topics in this emerging field are suggested.},

  abstract = {In deep supervised learning the structure of the artificial neural network determines how well and how fast it can be trained. This thesis uses evolutionary algorithms to optimize the structure of artificial neural networks. Specifically, the focus of this thesis is to develop strategies for efficient neuroevolution. The neuroevolutionary method presented in this report builds structures through architechtural morphisms that, approximately, preserve the functionality of the networks. The intended outcome of basing the mutations on the idea of function preservation was that new architechtures would start out in a high performance parameter space region. By skipping regions of low performance, the training of previous generations can be accumulated. The proposed method was evaluated relative to version in which the preservating property of the mutations was removed. In the ablated version the parameters associated with the new structural change were randomly initialized. The two versions were benchmarked on five different regression problems. On the three most difficult problems the ablated version demonstrated better performance than the preservering version, while similar performance was observed for the two other problems. The performance difference between the two versions was inferred to a more frequent tendency for the function preserving version to get entrapped in stationary regions, compared to the ablated version. The parameter initializations associated with the ablated version allow the backpropagation to more easily escape these stationary regions.},

  abstract = {Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is the process of automating architecture engineering, searching for the best deep learning configuration. One of the main NAS approaches proposed in the literature, Progressive Neural Architecture Search (PNAS), seeks for the architectures with a sequential model-based optimization strategy: it defines a common recursive structure to generate the networks, whose number of building blocks rises through iterations. However, NAS algorithms are generally designed for an ideal setting without considering the needs and the technical constraints imposed by practical applications. In this paper, we propose a new architecture search named Pareto-Optimal Progressive Neural Architecture Search (POPNAS) that combines the benefits of PNAS to a time-accuracy Pareto optimization problem. POPNAS adds a new time predictor to the existing approach to carry out a joint prediction of time and accuracy for each candidate neural network, searching through the Pareto front. This allows us to reach a trade-off between accuracy and training time, identifying neural network architectures with competitive accuracy in the face of a drastically reduced training time.},

We explored \$CompNet\$, in which case we morph a well-trained neural network to a deeper one where network function can be preserved and the added layer is compact. The work of the paper makes two contributions: a). The modified network can converge fast and keep the same functionality so that we do not need to train from scratch again; b). The layer size of the added layer in the neural network is controlled by removing the redundant parameters with sparse optimization. This differs from previous network morphism approaches which tend to add more neurons or channels beyond the actual requirements and result in redundance of the model. The method is illustrated using several neural network structures on different data sets including MNIST and CIFAR10.},

We build upon this intuition and take into account more elaborated affine transformations of the convolutional weights that include learned binary masks. We show that with our generalization it is possible to achieve significantly higher levels of adaptation to new tasks, enabling the approach to compete with fine tuning strategies by requiring slightly more than 1 bit per network parameter per additional task. Experiments on two popular benchmarks showcase the power of our approach, that achieves the new state of the art on the Visual Decathlon Challenge.},

Under the standard paradigm of network fine-tuning, an entirely new CNN is learned per task, and the final network size is independent of task complexity. This is wasteful, since simple tasks require smaller networks than more complex tasks, and limits the number of tasks that can be solved simultaneously. To address these problems, we propose a transfer learning procedure, denoted NetTailor, in which layers of a pre-trained CNN are used as universal blocks that can be combined with small task-specific layers to generate new networks. Besides minimizing classification error, the new network is trained to mimic the internal activations of a strong unconstrained CNN, and minimize its complexity by the combination of 1) a soft-attention mechanism over blocks and 2) complexity regularization constraints. In this way, NetTailor can adapt the network architecture, not just its weights, to the target task. Experiments show that networks adapted to simple tasks, such as character or traffic sign recognition, become significantly smaller than those adapted to hard tasks, such as fine-grained recognition. More importantly, due to the modular nature of the procedure, this reduction in network complexity is achieved without compromise of either parameter sharing across tasks, or classification accuracy.},

It is based on the growing neural gas (GNG), which learns a general graph with no special provisions for datasets with separated clusters. On the contrary, the proposed GNF learns a set of trees so that each tree represents a connected cluster of data. High dimensional datasets often contain large empty regions among clusters, so this proposal is better suited to them than other self-organizing models because it represents these separated clusters as connected components made of neurons. Experimental results are reported which show the self-organization capabilities of the model. Moreover, its suitability for unsupervised clustering and foreground detection applications is demonstrated. In particular, the GNF is shown to correctly discover the connected component structure of some datasets.

  abstract = {Automatically determining the optimal size of a neural network for a given task without prior information currently requires an expensive global search and training many networks from scratch. In this paper, we address the problem of automatically finding a good network size during a single training cycle. We introduce nonparametric neural networks, a non-probabilistic framework for conducting optimization over all possible network sizes and prove its soundness when network growth is limited via an p penalty. We train networks under this framework by continuously adding new units while eliminating redundant units via an 2 penalty. We employ a novel optimization algorithm, which we term ``Adaptive Radial-Angular Gradient Descent'' or AdaRad, and obtain promising results.},

  abstract = {Continual learning of deep neural networks is a key requirement for scaling them up to more complex applicative scenarios and for achieving real lifelong learning of these architectures. Previous approaches to the problem have considered either the progressive increase in the size of the networks, or have tried to regularize the network behavior to equalize it with respect to previously observed tasks. In the latter case, it is essential to understand what type of information best represents this past behavior. Common techniques include regularizing the past outputs, gradients, or individual weights. In this work, we propose a new, relatively simple and efficient method to perform continual learning by regularizing instead the network internal embeddings. To make the approach scalable, we also propose a dynamic sampling strategy to reduce the memory footprint of the required external storage. We show that our method performs favorably with respect to state-of-the-art approaches in the literature, while requiring significantly less space in memory and computational time. In addition, inspired inspired by to recent works, we evaluate the impact of selecting a more flexible model for the activation functions inside the network, evaluating the impact of catastrophic forgetting on the activation functions themselves.},

Artificial neural networks, however, rely on human-designed, hand-programmed architectures for their remarkable performance. Can we develop artificial computational devices that can grow and self-organize without human intervention? In this paper, we propose a biologically inspired developmental algorithm that can 'grow' a functional, layered neural network from a single initial cell. The algorithm organizes inter-layer connections to construct a convolutional pooling layer, a key constituent of convolutional neural networks (CNN's). Our approach is inspired by the mechanisms employed by the early visual system to wire the retina to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), days before animals open their eyes. The key ingredients for robust self-organization are an emergent spontaneous spatiotemporal activity wave in the first layer and a local learning rule in the second layer that 'learns' the underlying activity pattern in the first layer. The algorithm is adaptable to a wide-range of input-layer geometries, robust to malfunctioning units in the first layer, and so can be used to successfully grow and self-organize pooling architectures of different pool-sizes and shapes. The algorithm provides a primitive procedure for constructing layered neural networks through growth and self-organization. Broadly, our work shows that biologically inspired developmental algorithms can be applied to autonomously grow functional 'brains' in-silico.},

We propose a method which fully preserves performance on the original task, with only a small increase (around 20\%) in the number of required parameters while performing on par with more costly finetuning procedures, which typically double the number of parameters. The learned architecture can be controlled to switch between various learned representations, enabling a single network to solve a task from multiple different domains.

Also, previously seen training samples may not be available at the time of retraining. We propose an efficient training methodology and incrementally growing DCNN to learn new tasks while sharing part of the base network. Our proposed methodology is inspired by transfer learning techniques, although it does not forget previously learned tasks. An updated network, for learning new set of classes, is formed using previously learned convolutional layers (shared from initial part of base network) with addition of few newly added convolutional kernels included in the later layers of the network. We employed a `clone-and-branch' technique with calibration, which allows the network to learn new tasks (containing classes with similar features as old tasks) one after another without any performance loss in old tasks. We evaluated the proposed scheme on several recognition applications. The classification accuracy achieved by our approach is comparable to the regular incremental learning approach (where networks are updated with new training samples only, without any network sharing), while achieving energy efficiency, reduction in storage requirements, memory access and training time.},

However, designing an optimized early-exit strategy is a difficult task, generally requiring a large amount of manual fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose a way to jointly optimize this strategy together with the branches, providing an end-to-end trainable algorithm for this emerging class of neural networks. We achieve this by replacing the original output of the branches with a `soft', differentiable approximation. In addition, we also propose a regularization approach to trade-off the computational efficiency of the early-exit strategy with respect to the overall classification accuracy.

However, picking a sufficiently good network topology usually relies on expert human knowledge. Neural architecture search aims to reduce the extent of expertise that is needed. Modern architecture search techniques often rely on immense computational power, or apply trained meta-controllers for decision making. We develop a framework for a genetic algorithm that is both computationally cheap and makes decisions based on mathematical criteria rather than trained parameters. It is a hybrid approach that fuses training and topology optimization together into one process. Structural modifications that are performed include adding or removing layers of neurons, with some re-training applied to make up for incurred change in input-output behaviour. Our ansatz is tested on both the SVHN and (augmented) CIFAR-10 datasets with limited computational overhead compared to training only the baseline. This algorithm can achieve a significant increase in accuracy (as compared to a fully trained baseline), rescue insufficient topologies that in their current state are only able to learn to a limited extent, and dynamically reduce network size without loss in achieved accuracy.},

  abstract = {As a result of the growing size of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), the gap to hardware capabilities in terms of memory and compute increases. To effectively compress DNNs, quantization and connection pruning are usually considered. However, unconstrained pruning usually leads to unstructured parallelism, which maps poorly to massively parallel processors, and substantially reduces the efficiency of general-purpose processors. Similar applies to quantization, which often requires dedicated hardware. We propose Parameterized Structured Pruning (PSP), a novel method to dynamically learn the shape of DNNs through structured sparsity. PSP parameterizes structures (e.g. channel- or layer-wise) in a weight tensor and leverages weight decay to learn a clear distinction between important and unimportant structures. As a result, PSP maintains prediction performance, creates a substantial amount of sparsity that is structured and, thus, easy and efficient to map to a variety of massively parallel processors, which are mandatory for utmost compute power and energy efficiency. PSP is experimentally validated on the popular CIFAR10/100 and ILSVRC2012 datasets using ResNet and DenseNet architectures, respectively.},

It has revolutionized the field of image analysis and the algorithms are now being employed in research field outside of computer science. The methods do however suffer from several drawbacks such as large computational costs. In this thesis alternative methods for training the underlying networks are evaluated. These methods are based on gradually growing networks during training using layer-by-layer training as well as increasing network width. These training methods lend themselves to easily implementing networks of tune-able size allowing for tradeoff between high accuracy and fast execution or the construction of modular networks in which one can chose to execute only a small part of the network to get a very fast prediction at the cost of some accuracy. The layer-by-layer method is applied to multiple different image analysis tasks and the performance is evaluated and compared to that of regular training. Both the layer by layer training and the breadth training are comparable to normal training in performance. The modular nature of the networks make them suitable for applications within multi-particle tracking.},

Continual adaptability and automation of neural networks is of paramount importance to several domains where model accessibility is limited after deployment (e.g IoT devices, selfdriving vehicles, etc). Additionally, even accessible models require frequent maintenance post-deployment to overcome issues such as Concept/Data Drift, which can be cumbersome and restrictive.

Central to our approach is a novel, interpretable, parameterization of the shared, multi-task architecture space, which then enables computing globally optimal architectures using Bayesian optimization. Experiments on continual learning benchmarks show that our framework performs comparably with earlier expansion based approaches and is able to flexibly compute multiple optimal solutions with performance-size trade-offs.},

  abstract = {The current standard approach to scaling transformer language models trains each model size from a different random initialization. As an alternative, we consider a staged training setup that begins with a small model and incrementally increases the amount of compute used for training by applying a ``growth operator'' to increase the model depth and width. By initializing each stage with the output of the previous one, the training process effectively re-uses the compute from prior stages and becomes more efficient. Our growth operators each take as input the entire training state (including model parameters, optimizer state, learning rate schedule, etc.) and output a new training state from which training continues. We identify two important properties of these growth operators, namely that they preserve both the loss and the ``training dynamics'' after applying the operator. While the losspreserving property has been discussed previously, to the best of our knowledge this work is the first to identify the importance of preserving the training dynamics (the rate of decrease of the loss during training). To find the optimal schedule for stages, we use the scaling laws from (Kaplan et al., 2020) to find a precise schedule that gives the most compute saving by starting a new stage when training efficiency starts decreasing. We empirically validate our growth operators and staged training for autoregressive language models, showing up to 22\% compute savings compared to a strong baseline trained from scratch.

We propose several manifestations for training neural networks, including algorithmic examples (via hyper-parameters and loss functions), data-based examples, and model-based examples. Specifically, we introduce several novel techniques: cyclical weight decay, cyclical batch size, cyclical focal loss, cyclical softmax temperature, cyclical data augmentation, cyclical gradient clipping, and cyclical semi-supervised learning. In addition, we demonstrate that cyclical weight decay, cyclical softmax temperature, and cyclical gradient clipping (as three examples of this principle) are beneficial in the test accuracy performance of a trained model. Furthermore, we discuss model-based examples (such as pretraining and knowledge distillation) from the perspective of general cyclical training and recommend some changes to the typical training methodology. In summary, this paper defines the general cyclical training concept and discusses several specific ways in which this concept can be applied to training neural networks.

Specifically, we contribute the following: first, we create a strong baseline approach for incremental learning based on Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) and state-of-the-art incremental learning strategies, outperforming many existing strategies trained with similar-sized popular architectures; second, we extend the idea of architecture search to regularize architecture forgetting, boosting performance past our proposed baseline. We evaluate our method on both RF signal and image classification tasks, and demonstrate we can achieve up to a 10\% performance increase over state-of-the-art methods. Most importantly, our contribution enables learning from continuous distributions on real-world application data for which the complexity of the data distribution is unknown, or the modality less explored (such as RF signal classification).},

While prebuilt network models exist for certain scenarios, to try and meet the constraints that are unique to each application, AI teams need to think about developing custom neural network architectures that can meet the tradeoff between accuracy and memory footprint to achieve the tight constraints of their unique use-cases.

  abstract = {We present a deep neural-network model for lifelong learning inspired by several forms of neuroplasticity. The neural network develops continuously in response to signals from the environment. In the beginning the network is a blank slate with no nodes at all. It develops according to four rules: (i) expansion, which adds new nodes to memorize new input combinations; (ii) generalization, which adds new nodes that generalize from existing ones; (iii) forgetting, which removes nodes that are of relatively little use; and (iv) backpropagation, which fine-tunes the network parameters. We analyze the model from the perspective of accuracy, energy efficiency, and versatility and compare it to other network models, finding better performance in several cases.},

  abstract = {Designing energy-efficient networks is of critical importance for enabling state-of-the-art deep learning in mobile and edge settings where the computation and energy budgets are highly limited. Recently, Liu et al. (2019) framed the search of efficient neural architectures into a continuous splitting process: it iteratively splits existing neurons into multiple off-springs to achieve progressive loss minimization, thus finding novel architectures by gradually growing the neural network. However, this method was not specifically tailored for designing energy-efficient networks, and is computationally expensive on large-scale benchmarks. In this work, we substantially improve Liu et al. (2019) in two significant ways: 1) we incorporate the energy cost of splitting different neurons to better guide the splitting process, thereby discovering more energy-efficient network architectures; 2) we substantially speed up the splitting process of Liu et al. (2019), which requires expensive eigen-decomposition, by proposing a highly scalable Rayleigh-quotient stochastic gradient algorithm. Our fast algorithm allows us to reduce the computational cost of splitting to the same level of typical back-propagation updates and enables efficient implementation on GPU. Extensive empirical results show that our method can train highly accurate and energy-efficient networks on challenging datasets such as ImageNet, improving a variety of baselines, including the pruning-based methods and expert-designed architectures.},

  abstract = {CNNs have made an undeniable impact on computer vision through the ability to learn high-capacity models with large annotated training sets. One of their remarkable properties is the ability to transfer knowledge from a large source dataset to a (typically smaller) target dataset. This is usually accomplished through fine-tuning a fixed-size network on new target data. Indeed, virtually every contemporary visual recognition system makes use of fine-tuning to transfer knowledge from ImageNet. In this work, we analyze what components and parameters change during finetuning, and discover that increasing model capacity allows for more natural model adaptation through fine-tuning. By making an analogy to developmental learning, we demonstrate that ``growing'' a CNN with additional units, either by widening existing layers or deepening the overall network, significantly outperforms classic fine-tuning approaches. But in order to properly grow a network, we show that newly-added units must be appropriately normalized to allow for a pace of learning that is consistent with existing units. We empirically validate our approach on several benchmark datasets, producing state-of-the-art results.},

  abstract = {Lifelong learning remains an open problem. One of its main difficulties is catastrophic forgetting. Many dynamic expansion approaches have been proposed to address this problem, but they all use homogeneous models of predefined structure for all tasks. The common original model and expansion structures ignore the requirement of different model structures on different tasks, which leads to a less compact model for multiple tasks and causes the model size to increase rapidly as the number of tasks increases. Moreover, they can not perform best on all tasks. To solve those problems, in this paper, we propose a new lifelong learning framework named Searchable Extension Units (SEU) by introducing Neural Architecture Search into lifelong learning, which breaks down the need for a predefined original model and searches for specific extension units for different tasks, without compromising the performance of the model on different tasks. Our approach can obtain a much more compact model without catastrophic forgetting. The experimental results on the PMNIST, the split CIFAR10 dataset, the split CIFAR100 dataset, and the Mixture dataset empirically prove that our method can achieve higher accuracy with much smaller model, whose size is about 25-33 percentage of that of the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract = {Deep learning has brought great progress for the sequential recommendation (SR) tasks. With advanced network architectures, sequential recommender models can be stacked with many hidden layers, e.g., up to 100 layers on real-world recommendation datasets. Training such a deep network is difficult because it can be computationally very expensive and takes much longer time, especially in situations where there are tens of billions of user-item interactions. To deal with such a challenge, we present StackRec, a simple, yet very effective and efficient training framework for deep SR models by iterative layer stacking. Specifically, we first offer an important insight that hidden layers/blocks in a well-trained deep SR model have very similar distributions. Enlightened by this, we propose the stacking operation on the pre-trained layers/blocks to transfer knowledge from a shallower model to a deep model, then we perform iterative stacking so as to yield a much deeper but easier-to-train SR model. We validate the performance of StackRec by instantiating it with four state-of-the-art SR models in three practical scenarios with real-world datasets. Extensive experiments show that StackRec achieves not only comparable performance, but also substantial acceleration in training time, compared to SR models that are trained from scratch.

  abstract = {A deep belief network (DBN) is effective to create a powerful generative model by using training data. However, it is difficult to fast determine its optimal structure given specific applications. In this paper, a growing DBN with transfer learning (TL-GDBN) is proposed to automatically decide its structure size, which can accelerate its learning process and improve model accuracy. First, a basic DBN structure with single hidden layer is initialized and then pretrained, and the learned weight parameters are frozen. Second, TL-GDBN uses TL to transfer the knowledge from the learned weight parameters to newly added neurons and hidden layers, which can achieve a growing structure until the stopping criterion for pretraining is satisfied. Third, the weight parameters derived from pretraining of TL-GDBN are further fine-tuned by using layer-by-layer partial least square regression from top to bottom, which can avoid many problems of traditional backpropagation algorithm-based fine-tuning. Moreover, the convergence analysis of the TL-GDBN is presented. Finally, TL-GDBN is tested on two benchmark data sets and a practical wastewater treatment system. The simulation results show that it has better modeling performance, faster learning speed, and more robust structure than existing models. Note to Practitioners-Transfer learning (TL) aims to improve training effectiveness by transferring knowledge from a source domain to target domain. This paper presents a growing deep belief network (DBN) with TL to improve the training effectiveness and determine the optimal model size. Facing a complex process and real-world workflow, DBN tends to require long time for its successful training. The proposed growing DBN with TL (TL-GDBN) accelerates the learning process by instantaneously transferring the knowledge from a source domain to each new deeper or wider substructure. The experimental results show that the proposed TL-GDBN model has a great potential to deal with complex system, especially the systems with high nonlinearity. As a result, it can be readily applicable to some industrial nonlinear systems.},

The first requirement for this network morphism is its ability to handle diverse morphing types of networks, including changes of depth, width, kernel size, and even subnet. To meet this requirement, we first introduce the network morphism equations, and then develop novel morphing algorithms for all these morphing types for both classic and convolutional neural networks. The second requirement for this network morphism is its ability to deal with nonlinearity in a network. We propose a family of parametric-activation functions to facilitate the morphing of any continuous non-linear activation neurons.

The morphed network also has the potential to continue growing into a more powerful one as it has more parameters. Existing network morphism schemes include Net2Net and NetMorph. However, both of them suffer from significant initial performance drop when the morphed network is continually trained. Such unstability is very much undesired for a continual learning system. In this research, we first identify the reason for the unstability, which is due to the large amount of zeros padded into the parameters. Based on this observation, we propose an algorithm based on modified gradient descent to decompose the network morphism equation. As a result, the morphed parameters are all non-zeros and the continual training process become stable.

We propose a novel neuro-evolutionary technique to solve this problem without human interference. Our method assumes that a convolutional neural network architecture is a sequence of neuro-cells and keeps mutating them using function-preserving operations. This novel combination of approaches has several advantages. We define the network architecture by a sequence of repeating neuro-cells which reduces the search space complexity. Furthermore, these cells are possibly transferable and can be used in order to arbitrarily extend the complexity of the network. Mutations based on function-preserving operations guarantee better parameter initialization than random initialization such that less training time is required per network architecture. Our proposed method finds within 12 GPU hours neural network architectures that can achieve a classification error of about 4\% and 24\% with only 5.5 and 6.5 million parameters on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, respectively. In comparison to competitor approaches, our method provides similar competitive results but requires orders of magnitudes less search time and in many cases less network parameters.},

  abstract = {Developing efficient and principled neural architecture optimization methods is a critical challenge of modern deep learning. Recently, Liu et al.[19] proposed a splitting steepest descent (S2D) method that jointly optimizes the neural parameters and architectures based on progressively growing network structures by splitting neurons into multiple copies in a steepest descent fashion. However, S2D suffers from a local optimality issue when all the neurons become "splitting stable", a concept akin to local stability in parametric optimization. In this work, we develop a significant and surprising extension of the splitting descent framework that addresses the local optimality issue. The idea is to observe that the original S2D is unnecessarily restricted to splitting neurons into positive weighted copies. By simply allowing both positive and negative weights during splitting, we can eliminate the appearance of splitting stability in S2D and hence escape the local optima to obtain better performance. By incorporating signed splittings, we significantly extend the optimization power of splitting steepest descent both theoretically and empirically. We verify our method on various challenging benchmarks such as CIFAR-100, ImageNet and ModelNet40, on which we outperform S2D and other advanced methods on learning accurate and energy-efficient neural networks.},

  abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been deployed in myriad machine learning applications. However, advances in their accuracy are often achieved with increasingly complex and deep network architectures. These large, deep models are often unsuitable for real-world applications, due to their massive computational cost, high memory bandwidth, and long latency. For example, autonomous driving requires fast inference based on Internet-of-Things (IoT) edge devices operating under run-time energy and memory storage constraints. In such cases, compact DNNs can facilitate deployment due to their reduced energy consumption, memory requirement, and inference latency. Long short-term memories (LSTMs) are a type of recurrent neural network that have also found widespread use in the context of sequential data modeling. They also face a model size vs. accuracy trade-off. In this paper, we review major approaches for automatically synthesizing compact, yet accurate, DNN/LSTM models suitable for real-world applications. We also outline some challenges and future areas of exploration.},

From this perspective, we summarize existing approaches into several categories according to their efforts in bridging the gap, and we analyze both advantages and disadvantages of these methodologies.

  abstract = {Continual learning paradigm learns from a continuous stream of tasks in an incremental manner and aims to overcome the notorious issue: the catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we propose a new adaptive progressive network framework including two models for continual learning: Reinforced Continual Learning (RCL) and Bayesian Optimized Continual Learning with Attention mechanism (BOCL) to solve this fundamental issue. The core idea of this framework is to dynamically and adaptively expand the neural network structure upon the arrival of new tasks. RCL and BOCL employ reinforcement learning and Bayesian optimization to achieve it, respectively. An outstanding advantage of our proposed framework is that it will not forget the knowledge that has been learned through adaptively controlling the architecture. We propose effective ways of employing the learned knowledge in the two methods to control the size of the network. RCL employs previous knowledge directly while BOCL selectively utilizes previous knowledge (e.g., feature maps of previous tasks) via attention mechanism. The experiments on variants of MNIST, CIFAR-100 and Sequence of 5-Datasets demonstrate that our methods outperform the state-of-the-art in preventing catastrophic forgetting and fitting new tasks better under the same or less computing resource.},

  abstract = {Catastrophic forgetting is a notorious issue in deep learning, referring to the fact that Deep Neural Networks (DNN) could forget the knowledge about earlier tasks when learning new tasks. To address this issue, continual learning has been developed to learn new tasks sequentially and perform knowledge transfer from the old tasks to the new ones without forgetting. While recent structure-based learning methods show the capability of alleviating the forgetting problem, these methods start from a redundant full-size network and require a complex learning process to gradually grow-and-prune or search the network structure for each task, which is inefficient. To address this problem and enable efficient network expansion for new tasks, we first develop a learnable sparse growth method eliminating the additional pruning/searching step in previous structure-based methods. Building on this learnable sparse growth method, we then propose GROWN, a novel end-to-end continual learning framework to dynamically grow the model only when necessary. Different from all previous structure-based methods, GROWN starts from a small seed network, instead of a full-sized one. We validate GROWN on multiple dataset against state-of-the-art methods, which shows superiority performance in both accuracy and model size. For example, we achieve 1.0\% accuracy gain in average compared to the current SOTA results on CIFAR-100 Superclass 20 tasks setting.},

  abstract = {This work proposes an algorithm, called NetAdapt, that automatically adapts a pre-trained deep neural network to a mobile platform given a resource budget. While many existing algorithms simplify networks based on the number of MACs or weights, optimizing those indirect metrics may not necessarily reduce the direct metrics, such as latency and energy consumption. To solve this problem, NetAdapt incorporates direct metrics into its adaptation algorithm. These direct metrics are evaluated using empirical measurements, so that detailed knowledge of the platform and toolchain is not required. NetAdapt automatically and progressively simplifies a pre-trained network until the resource budget is met while maximizing the accuracy. Experiment results show that NetAdapt achieves better accuracy versus latency trade-offs on both mobile CPU and mobile GPU, compared with the state-of-the-art automated network simplification algorithms. For image classification on the ImageNet dataset, NetAdapt achieves up to a 1.7\$\textbackslash times\$ speedup in measured inference latency with equal or higher accuracy on MobileNets (V1\&V2).},

DEN is efficiently trained in an online manner by performing selective retraining, dynamically expands network capacity upon arrival of each task with only the necessary number of units, and effectively prevents semantic drift by splitting/duplicating units and timestamping them. We validate DEN on multiple public datasets under lifelong learning scenarios, on which it not only significantly outperforms existing lifelong learning methods for deep networks, but also achieves the same level of performance as the batch counterparts with substantially fewer number of parameters. Further, the obtained network fine-tuned on all tasks obtained siginficantly better performance over the batch models, which shows that it can be used to estimate the optimal network structure even when all tasks are available in the first place.},

As training every child model from scratch is very time-consuming, recent works leverage weight-sharing to speed up the model evaluation procedure. These approaches greatly reduce computation by maintaining a single copy of weights on the super-net and share the weights among every child model. However, weight-sharing has no theoretical guarantee and its impact has not been well studied before. In this paper, we conduct comprehensive experiments to reveal the impact of weight-sharing: (1) The best-performing models from different runs or even from consecutive epochs within the same run have significant variance; (2) Even with high variance, we can extract valuable information from training the super-net with shared weights; (3) The interference between child models is a main factor that induces high variance; (4) Properly reducing the degree of weight sharing could effectively reduce variance and improve performance.},

  abstract = {Continual learning (CL), the problem of lifelong learning where tasks arrive in sequence, has attracted increasing attention in the computer vision community lately. The goal of CL is to learn new tasks while maintaining the performance on the previously learned tasks. There are two major obstacles for CL of deep neural networks: catastrophic forgetting and limited model capacity. Inspired by the recent breakthroughs in automatically learning good neural network architectures, we develop a nonexpansive AutoML framework for CL termed Regularize, Expand and Compress (REC) to solve the above issues. REC is a unified framework with three highlights: 1) a novel regularized weight consolidation (RWC) algorithm to avoid forgetting, where accessing the data seen in the previously learned tasks is not required; 2) an automatic neural architecture search (AutoML) engine to expand the network to increase model capability; 3) smart compression of the expanded model after a new task is learned to improve the model efficiency. The experimental results on four different image recognition datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed REC over other CL algorithms.},

  abstract = {Developing neural network image classification models often requires significant architecture engineering. In this paper, we study a method to learn the model architectures directly on the dataset of interest. As this approach is expensive when the dataset is large, we propose to search for an architectural building block on a small dataset and then transfer the block to a larger dataset. The key contribution of this work is the design of a new search space (the "NASNet search space") which enables transferability. In our experiments, we search for the best convolutional layer (or "cell") on the CIFAR-10 dataset and then apply this cell to the ImageNet dataset by stacking together more copies of this cell, each with their own parameters to design a convolutional architecture, named "NASNet architecture". We also introduce a new regularization technique called ScheduledDropPath that significantly improves generalization in the NASNet models. On CIFAR-10 itself, NASNet achieves 2.4\% error rate, which is state-of-the-art. On ImageNet, NASNet achieves, among the published works, state-of-the-art accuracy of 82.7\% top-1 and 96.2\% top-5 on ImageNet. Our model is 1.2\% better in top-1 accuracy than the best human-invented architectures while having 9 billion fewer FLOPS - a reduction of 28\% in computational demand from the previous state-of-the-art model. When evaluated at different levels of computational cost, accuracies of NASNets exceed those of the state-of-the-art human-designed models. For instance, a small version of NASNet also achieves 74\% top-1 accuracy, which is 3.1\% better than equivalently-sized, state-of-the-art models for mobile platforms. Finally, the learned features by NASNet used with the Faster-RCNN framework surpass state-of-the-art by 4.0\% achieving 43.1\% mAP on the COCO dataset.},

Despite their success, neural networks are still hard to design. In this paper, we use a recurrent network to generate the model descriptions of neural networks and train this RNN with reinforcement learning to maximize the expected accuracy of the generated architectures on a validation set. On the CIFAR-10 dataset, our method, starting from scratch, can design a novel network architecture that rivals the best human-invented architecture in terms of test set accuracy. Our CIFAR-10 model achieves a test error rate of 3.65, which is 0.09 percent better and 1.05x faster than the previous state-of-the-art model that used a similar architectural scheme. On the Penn Treebank dataset, our model can compose a novel recurrent cell that outperforms the widely-used LSTM cell, and other state-of-the-art baselines. Our cell achieves a test set perplexity of 62.4 on the Penn Treebank, which is 3.6 perplexity better than the previous state-of-the-art model. The cell can also be transferred to the character language modeling task on PTB and achieves a state-of-the-art perplexity of 1.214.},
