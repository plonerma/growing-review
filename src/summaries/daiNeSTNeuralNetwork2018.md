@daiNeSTNeuralNetwork2018 utilize growth with network architecture search (NAS)
in mind. They note that trial-and-error approaches are inefficient as a process
and can (as a product) lead to inefficient architectures which might far more
parameters than required.
To combat these issues, they propose NeST, which trains
weights as well as the architecture.

NeST starts with an initial small network (a *seed architecture*). In a first
phase, the network is grown by adding new connections based on their gradient
(assuming they already existed with an weight of 0), and growing new neurons
in a layer $l$ in order to connect existing neurons $n$ and $m$ in layers $l-1$ and $l+1$
which if they were connected directly, exhibited a large gradient magnitude:

$$
G_{m,n} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial u_m^{l+1}} x_n^{l-1} \ge threshold
$$

Here, $u_m^{l+1}$ is the sum of incoming activiations of neuron $m$ in layer $l+1$
and $x_n^{l-1}$ is the activation of neuron $n$ in layer $l+1$.
The threshold is calculated using a growth proportion.

In a second phase, weights are iteratively prruned. Between each pruning step,
the network is retrained to recover its performance.
