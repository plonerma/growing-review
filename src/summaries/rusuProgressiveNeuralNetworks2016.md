@rusuProgressiveNeuralNetworks2016 develop *Progressive Networks* for tackling
catastrophic forgetting. The idea is to grow networks when learning new tasks.
The older parts of the networks are frozen and their function incorporated
using adapters to allow for knowledge transfer from earlier tasks.
Each time a new tasks is learned, the network is further extended (a new column
is added).


![Figure from @rusuProgressiveNeuralNetworks2016 illustrating the use of columns and adapters.](img/progressive_nn_columns){#fig:progressive_nn_columns width=10cm}

During inference (as well as during training), a task identifier is needed
to select the column which matches the current task.
By freezing the older parts of the networks during training, the performance on
tasks learned in early training is guaranteed to remain stable, as the respective
weights (and therefore the models function) cannot change.
